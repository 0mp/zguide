* How do we tunnel 0MQ connections over 0MQ connections?
    - e.g. to get 3-4 ports into DMZ via one single port
    - two devices, one reads, one writes
    - over other protocols: HTTP, SSH, etc...?
    - acts as split device, ...

* Cross-language string sending tutorial

* How to publish selectively to individual subscribers:

When a client activates, it chooses a random port that is not in use and creates a SUB socket listening for all traffic on it. The client then sends a message via REQ to the publisher containing the port that it is listening on. The publisher receives this message, acknowledges it, and creates a new pub socket specific to that client. All published events specific to this client go out that socket.

When the client deactivates, it sends a message to the publisher with the port to deactivate and close.

You end up creating a lot more PUB sockets on your server end and doing all of the filtering at the server. This sounds acceptable to you.

I didn't need to do this to avoid network bandwidth bottlenecks; I created this to enforce some security and entitlements.


I highly recommend that you try out the simpler topology and *verifying* that 0mq cannot keep up with your message rates when publishing all data to all clients. With smart topics the client can reject the data *very* fast. A 1 GB or 10 Gb switched network can also move quite a bit of data without a lot of blocking behavior in the hardware too. You may be able to save yourself a lot of unnecessary work, so just try it.
