+++ File Transfer

We now have a robust framework for creating groups of nodes, and letting them chat to each other. As a next step


+++ State Synchronization

- peer property request/reply

+++ High-Level APIs

+++ Security

+++ Bridging

(More coming soon)

++++ The Messaging Layer

So we've solved discovery, presence, connectivity, and simulation. Next on our list: security, unicast messaging, and multicast messaging.

- SASL security


- one-to-one messaging by sending to node
- one-to-many messaging by sending to group
    - join group, leave group
    - group management across all nodes

++++ File Transfer

Take FILEMQ and plug into this framework.

+++ Bridging

- why and how
- semantic compatibility
- example 0MQ to HTTP
- using zxxx library?

+++ Decentralised Logging System

- pubsub log events
- filter levels
- capture in log files or memory
- dynamic graphing
- log file cycling

+++ Timer Service

- ticks, 1/10, 1/100, etc.

+++ Disconnected Security
    
Chapter 9 topics

- the wire level protocol
- a minimal TCP stack
- internals of 0MQ
- generate bindings in
    Python
    C#
    Java
    Ruby

0MQ's pipeline pattern (using PUSH and PULL sockets) is reliable to the extent that:

* Workers and collectors don't crash;
* Workers and collectors read their data fast enough to avoid queue overflows.

As with all our reliability patterns, we'll ignore what happens if an upstream node (the ventilator for a pipeline pattern) dies. In practice a ventilator will be the client of another reliability pattern, e.g. Clone.

The Xyz pattern takes pipeline and makes it robust against the only failure we can reasonably handle, namely workers and (less commonly) collectors that crash and lose messages or work.

- assume workers are idempotent
- assume batch size is known in advance (because...)
- assume memory enough to hold full batch
- batch: start (address of collector), tasks, end
- messages numbered 0 upwards inside batch
- assume multiple ventilators for same cluster
- assume collector talks to ventilator, (not same to allow walk-up-and use by ventilators)
- call ventilator the 'client'
- if task missing, resend
- if end of batch missing, resend from last response
