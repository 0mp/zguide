No-one has translated the rtdealer example into Haskell yet.  Be the first to create
rtdealer in Haskell and get one free Internet!  If you're the author of the Haskell
binding, this is a great way to get people to use 0MQ in Haskell.

To submit a new translation email it to 1000 4 20 24 25 29 30 44 46 107 109 114 121 1000EMAIL).  Please:

* Stick to identical functionality and naming used in examples so that readers
  can easily compare languages.
* You MUST place your name as author in the examples so readers can contact you.
* You MUST state in the email that you license your code under the MIT/X11
  license.
