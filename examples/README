Welcome
-------

These examples from the 0MQ Guide help people to learn and use 0MQ.  While we
wrote most of the examples in C, we welcome translations into other languages.

Contributing
------------

Please send your translations, and fixes as patches to the zeromq-dev list
with the subject line "[PATCH] zguide: <filename>". We'll review the code and
add it to the zguide repository if it's ok.

Please:

* Stick to identical functionality and naming used in examples so that readers
  can easily compare languages.
* Explicitly state that you license your contribution under the MIT/X11 license.
* Put your name as author in the examples so readers can contact you.
