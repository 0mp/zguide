++ Preface

// Say a little about how this book was written and what relationships the various authors have to the 0MQ project. //

+++ Audience

This book is written for programmers. We assume you can read C code,
because most of the examples are in C even though ZeroMQ can be used
in many languages. Other than that basic background, we try to present
all the concepts in networking and distributed computing you will need
to use ZeroMQ.
