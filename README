The Guide is written by Pieter Hintjens, with help from Martin Sustrik, Gonzalo
Diethelm, Zed Shaw, CAF, Guido Goldstein, Oliver Smith,  Pierre Rouleau, Peter
Alexander, and others.  We cover 0MQ version 2.x.Add errata and suggestions to
http://www.zeromq.org/docs:user-guide-talk or as patches off this git emailed to
ph@imatix.com.

To build the Guide you need Ditaa (included in this repository), ImageMagick, perl.
Run the command: "zmq chapter*.txt".  The result is in wdtemp.txt.

Currently, formats the output for Wikidot.com, ready for pasting into a page at
www.zeromq.org.  Images are hosted here at github.com and to modify an image you
must commit it to this repository.
