The Guide is written by Pieter Hintjens, with help from Martin Sustrik, Gonzalo
Diethelm, Zed Shaw, CAF, Guido Goldstein, Oliver Smith,  Pierre Rouleau, Peter
Alexander, and others.  We cover 0MQ version 2.x.  Please do not edit this page
directly, but instead add errata and suggestions to the [/docs:user-guide-talk
talk page] or as patches off this git emailed to ph@imatix.com.  The diagrams
are built using ditaa.
