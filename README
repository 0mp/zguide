The Guide is written by Pieter Hintjens, with help from Martin Sustrik, Gonzalo
Diethelm, Zed Shaw, CAF, Guido Goldstein, Oliver Smith,  Pierre Rouleau, Peter
Alexander, and others.  We cover 0MQ version 2.x.  Add errata and suggestions to
http://www.zeromq.org/docs:user-guide-talk or as patches off this git emailed to
the zeromq-dev list.

To build the Guide you need Ditaa (included in this repository), ImageMagick, perl.
Run the command: "z2w chapter*.txt".  The result is in wdtemp.txt.

Currently, formats wdtemp.txt ready for pasting into a page at www.zeromq.org.
Images and source examples are hosted here at github.com and to modify an image
or example we commit it to this repository.
