++ Chapter 4 - Reliability Patterns

In Chapter Three we looked at advanced use of 0MQ's request-reply pattern with worked examples. In this chapter we'll look at the general question of reliability and build a set of reliable messaging patterns on top of 0MQ's core patterns.

We'll cover:

* How we define 'reliability'.
* The most common types of failures we will experience in 0MQ applications.
* How to handle slow clients.
* How to build a reliable request-reply framework.
* How to build a reliable publish-subscribe framework.
* How to build a reliable push-pull pipeline framework.

+++ What is "Reliability"?

To understand what 'reliability' means, we have to look at its opposite, namely *failure*. If we can handle a certain set of failures, we are reliable with respect to those failures. No more, no less. So let's look at the possible causes of failure in a distributed 0MQ application, in roughly descending order of probability:

* Application code is the worst offender. It can crash and exit, freeze and stop responding to input, run too slowly for its input, exhaust all memory, etc.
* System code - like brokers we write using 0MQ - can die. System code should be more reliable than application code but can still crash and burn, and especially run out of memory if it tries to compensate for slow clients.
* Message queues can overflow, typically in system code that has learned to deal brutally with slow clients. When a queue overflows, it starts to discard messages.
* Networks can fail temporarily, causing intermittent message loss. Such errors are hidden to 0MQ applications since it automatically reconnects peers after a network-forced disconnection.
* Hardware can fail and take with it all the processes running on that box.
* Networks can fail in exotic ways, e.g. some ports on a switch may die and those parts of the network become inaccessible.
* Entire data centers can be struck by lightning, earthquakes, fire, or more mundane power or cooling failures.

To make a software system fully reliable against *all* of these possible failures is an enormously difficult and expensive job and goes beyond the scope of this modest guide.

Since the first five cases cover 99.9% of real world requirements outside large companies (according to a highly scientific study I just ran), that's what we'll look at. If you're a large company with money to spend on the last two cases, contact me immediately, there's a large hole behind my beach house waiting to be converted into a pool.

++++ The Slow Client Problem

In any high-volume architecture (data or workload distribution), applications need to be able to keep up with incoming data. The problem is that application developers too often don't have the skills to write fast code, or use languages that are inherently slow, or deploy to boxes that can easily run very slowly. Even a fast, well-written client application can appear to run "slowly" if the network is congested, or the application gets temporarily disconnected from the server.

Handling slow clients correctly is delicate. On the one hand, you really don't want to face application developers with an excuse like "sorry, our messaging layer lost your message somewhere". On the other hand, if you allow message queues to build up, especially in publishers that handle many clients, things just break.

0MQ does two things to handle the slow client problem:

* It moves messages as rapidly as possible to the client, and queues them there. In all the asynchronous messaging patterns (that is, all except synchronous request-reply), messages are sent to their destination without pause. By itself, this strategy avoids the bulk of queue overflow problems. If the client application runs out of memory, we don't really care.

* For cases where network congestion or client disconnection stops the sender getting rid of messages, 0MQ offers a "high water mark" that limits the size of a given socket queue. Since each use case has its own needs, 0MQ lets you set this per outgoing socket. When a queue hits the HWM, messages are just dropped. It's brutal, but there is no other sane strategy.

++++ Designing Reliability

So to make things brutally simple, reliability is "keeping things working properly when code freezes or crashes", a situation we'll shorten to "dies". However the things we want to keep working properly are more complex than just messages. We need to take each core 0MQ messaging pattern and see how to make it work (if we can) even when code dies.

Let's take them one by one:

* Request-reply: if the server dies (while processing a request), the client can figure that out since it won't get an answer back. Then it can give up in a huff, wait and try again later, find another server, etc. As for the client dying, we can brush that off as "someone else's problem" for now.

* Publish-subscribe: if the client dies (having gotten some data), the server doesn't know about it. Pubsub doesn't send any information back from client to server. But the client can contact the server out-of-band, e.g. via request-reply, and ask, "please resend everything I missed". As for the server dying, that's out of scope for here. Subscribers can also self-verify that they're not running too slowly, and take action (e.g. warn the operator, and die) if they are.

* Pipeline: if a worker dies (while working), the ventilator doesn't know about it. Pipelines, like pubsub, and the grinding gears of time, only work in one direction. But the downstream collector can detect that one task didn't get done, and send a message back to the ventilator saying, "hey, resend task 324!" If the ventilator or collector die, then whatever upstream client originally sent the work batch can get tired of waiting and resend the whole lot. It's not elegant but system code should really not die often enough to matter.

+++ Slow Subscriber Detection (Suicidal Snail Pattern)

One of the most common problems you will hit when using the pubsub pattern is the slow subscriber. In an ideal world, we stream data at full speed from publishers to subscribers. In reality, subscriber applications are often written in interpreted languages, or just do a lot of work, or are just badly written, to the extent that they can't keep up with publishers.

How do we handle a slow subscriber? The ideal fix is to make the subscriber faster, but that might take work and time. Some of the classic strategies for handling a slow subscriber are:

* **Queue messages on the publisher**. This is what Gmail does when I don't read my email for a couple of hours. But in high-volume messaging, pushing queues upstream has the thrilling but unprofitable result of making publishers run out of memory and crash. Especially if there are lots of subscribers and it's not possible to flush to disk for performance reasons.

* **Queue messages on the subscriber**. This is much better, and it's what 0MQ does by default if the network can keep up with things. If anyone's going to run out of memory and crash, it'll be the subscriber rather than the publisher, which is fair. This is perfect for "peaky" streams where a subscriber can't keep up for a while, but can catch up when the stream slows down. However it's no answer to a subscriber that's simply too slow in general.

* **Stop queuing new messages after a while**. This is what Gmail does when my mailbox overflows its 7.554GB, no 7.555GB of space. New messages just get rejected or dropped. This is a great strategy from the perspective of the publisher, and it's what 0MQ does when the publisher sets a high water mark or HWM. However it still doesn't help us fix the slow subscriber. Now we just get gaps in our message stream.

* **Punish slow subscribers with disconnect**. This is what Hotmail does when I don't login for two weeks, which is why I'm on my fifteenth Hotmail account. It's a nice brutal strategy that forces subscribers to sit up and pay attention, and would be ideal, but 0MQ doesn't do this, and there's no way to layer it on top since subscribers are invisible to publisher applications.

None of these classic strategies fit. So we need to get creative. Rather than disconnect the publisher, let's convince the subscriber to kill itself. This is the Suicidal Snail pattern. When a subscriber detects that it's running too slowly (where "too slowly" is presumably a configured option that really means "so slowly that if you ever get here, shout really loudly because I need to know, so I can fix this!"), it croaks and dies.

How can a subscriber detect this? One way would be to sequence messages (number them in order), and use a HWM at the publisher. Now, if the subscriber detects a gap (i.e. the numbering isn't consecutive), it knows something is wrong. We then tune the HWM to the "croak and die if you hit this" level.

There are two problems with this solution. One, if we have many publishers, how do we sequence messages? The solution is to give each publisher a unique ID and add that to the sequencing. Second, if subscribers use ZMQ_SUBSCRIBE filters, they will get gaps by definition. Our precious sequencing will be for nothing.

Some use cases won't use filters, and sequencing will work for them. But a more general solution is that the publisher timestamps each message. When a subscriber gets a message it checks the time, and if the difference is more than, say, one second, it does the "croak and die" thing. Possibly firing off a squawk to some operator console first.

The Suicide Snail pattern works especially when subscribers have their own clients and service-level agreements and need to guarantee certain maximum latencies. Aborting a subscriber may not seem like a constructive way to guarantee a maximum latency, but it's the assertion model. Abort today, and the problem will be fixed. Allow late data to flow downstream, and the problem may cause wider damage and take longer to appear on the radar.

So here is a minimal example of a Suicidal Snail:

[[code type="example" title="Suicidal Snail" name="suisnail"]]
[[/code]]

Notes about this example:

* The message here consists simply of the current system clock as a number of milliseconds. In a realistic application you'd have at least a message header with the timestamp, and a message body with data.
* The example has subscriber and publisher in a single process, as two threads. In reality they would be separate processes. Using threads is just convenient for the demonstration.

+++ Reliable Request-Reply (Pirate Pattern)

The basic request-reply pattern (a REQ client socket doing a blocking send/recv to a REP server socket) scores low on handling the most common types of failure. If the server crashes while processing the request, the client just hangs forever. If the network loses the request or the reply, the client hangs forever.

It is a lot better than TCP, thanks to 0MQ's ability to reconnect peers silently, to load-balance messages, and so on. But it's still not good enough for real work. The only use case where you can trust the basic request-reply pattern is between two threads in the same process where there's no network or separate server process to die.

However, with a little extra work this humble pattern becomes a good basis for real work across a distributed network, and we get a reliable request-reply pattern I like to call the "Pirate" pattern. RRR!

There are, roughly, three ways to connect clients to servers, each needing a specific approach to reliability:

* Multiple clients talking directly to a single server. Use case: single well-known server that clients need to talk to. Types of failure we aim to handle: server crashes and restarts, network disconnects.

* Multiple clients talking to a single queue device that distributes work to multiple servers. Use case: workload distribution to workers. Types of failure we aim to handle: worker crashes and restarts, worker busy looping, worker overload, queue crashes and restarts, network disconnects.

* Multiple clients talking to multiple servers with no intermediary devices. Use case: distributed services such as name resolution. Types of failure we aim to handle: service crashes and restarts, service busy looping, service overload, network disconnects.

Each of these has their trade-offs and often you'll mix them. We'll look at all three of these in detail.

++++ Pirate Client

The simplest Pirate pattern only requires changes in the client. Rather than doing a blocking receive, we:

* Poll the REQ socket and only receive from it when it's sure a reply has arrived.
* Resend a request several times, it no reply arrived within a timeout period.
* Abandon the transaction if after several requests, there is still no reply.

If you try to use a REQ socket in anything than a strict send-recv fashion, you'll get an EFSM error. This is slightly annoying when we want to use REQ in a pirate pattern, because we may send several requests before getting a reply. The pretty good brute-force solution is to close and reopen the REQ socket after an error:

[[code type="example" title="Pirate Client" name="piclient"]]
[[/code]]

Run this together with the matching server:

[[code type="example" title="Pirate Client server" name="server"]]
[[/code]]

To run this testcase, start the client and the server in two console windows. The server will randomly misbehave after a few messages. You can check the client's response. Here is a typical output from the server:

[[code]]
I: normal request (1)
I: normal request (2)
I: normal request (3)
I: simulating CPU overload
I: normal request (4)
I: simulating a crash
[[/code]]

And here is the client's response:

[[code]]
I: connecting to server...
I: server replied OK (1)
I: server replied OK (2)
I: server replied OK (3)
W: no response from server, retrying...
I: connecting to server...
W: no response from server, retrying...
I: connecting to server...
E: server seems to be offline, abandoning

           Figure # - Pirate Client
[[/code]]

The client sequences each message, and checks that replies come back exactly in order: that no requests or replies are lost, and no replies come back more than once, or out of order. Run the test a few times until you're convinced this mechanism actually works.

The client uses a REQ socket, and does the brute-force close/reopen because REQ sockets impose a strict send/receive cycle. You might be tempted to use an XREQ instead, but it would not be a good decision. First, it would mean emulating the secret sauce that REQ does with envelopes (if you've forgotten what that is, it's a good sign you don't want to have to do it). Second, it would mean potentially getting back replies that you didn't expect.

Handling failures only at the client works when we have a set of clients talking to a single server. It can handle a server crash, but only if recovery means restarting that same server. If there's a permanent error - e.g. a dead power supply on the server hardware - this approach won't work. Since the application code in servers is usually the biggest source of failures in any architecture, depending on a single server is not a great idea.

++++ Pirate Work Queues

Our second approach takes the pirate client pattern and extends it with a queue device that lets us talk, transparently, to multiple servers, which we can more accurately call 'workers'. Workers are stateless, or have some shared state we don't know about, e.g. a shared database. Having a queue device means workers can come and go without clients knowing anything about it. If one worker dies, another takes over. This is a nice simple topology with only one real weakness, namely the central queue itself, which can become a problem to manage, and a single point of failure.

We'll develop the pirate queue concept in stages, starting with a minimal working model. The basis for the pirate work queue pattern is the least-recently-used (LRU) routing queue from Chapter 3. What is the very //minimum// we need to do to handle dead or blocked workers? Turns out, its surprisingly little. We already have a retry mechanism in the client. So using the standard LRU queue will work pretty well. This fits with 0MQ's philosophy that we can extend a peer-to-peer pattern like request-reply by plugging naive devices in the middle.

Here is the queue, which is exactly a LRU queue, no more or less:

[[code type="example" title="Pirate Work Queue" name="piqueue"]]
[[/code]]

Here is the worker, which takes the piserver code and makes it work with the LRU queue (using the REQ 'ready' signaling):

[[code type="example" title="Pirate Work Queue worker" name="piworker"]]
[[/code]]

To test this, start a handlful of workers, a client, and the queue, in any order. You'll see that the workers eventually all crash and burn, and the client retries and then gives up. The queue never stops, and you can restart workers and clients ad-nauseam. This model works with any number of clients and workers.

discuss Disk-based Reliability

You can, and people do, use spinning rust to store messages. It rather makes a mess of the idea of "performance" but we're usually more comfortable knowing a really important message (such as that transfer of $400M to my Cyprus account) is stored on disk rather than only in memory. Spinning rust only makes sense for some patterns, mainly request-reply. If we get bored in this chapter we'll play with that, but otherwise, just shove really critical messages into a database that all parties can access, and skip 0MQ for those parts of your dialog.


Doing this right is non-trivial, as we'll see.
This is a fair amount of work to do and get right in every client application that needs reliability. It's simpler to place a queue device in the middle, to which all clients and servers connect. Now we can put the server management logic in that queue device.

Here is the architecture. We take the client-side pirate and add the LRU (least-recently used) queue broker from Chapter 3, with some extra sauce:

There are two levels of reliability at play here. First, from client to queue. Second, from queue to servers.

- if queue stops/restarts, workers need to detect, recreate socket or use XREP
-

### Handshaking at Startup

We must use XREP-to-XREP sockets because we want to connect N clients to N servers without (necessarily) an intermediary queue device.

In an XREP-to-XREP socket connection, one side of the connection must know the identity of the other.  You cannot do xrep-to-xrep flows between two anonymous sockets since an XREP socket requires an explicit identity.  In practice this means we will need a name service share the identities of the servers.  The client will connect to the server, then send it a message using the server's known identity as address, and then the server can respond to the client.

In this prototype we'll use fixed, hardcoded identities for the servers.  We'll develop the name service in a later prototype.



We assume that the servers - which contain application code - will crash far more often than the queue. So the client uses the client-side pirate pattern to create a reliable link to the queue. The real work of managing servers sits in the queue:


This example runs the clients, servers, and queue in a single process using multiple threads. In reality each of these layers would be a stand-alone process. The code is largely ready for that: each task already creates its own context.

Servers are just the same as the LRU worker tasks from the lruqueue example in Chapter 3. The server connects its REQ socket to the queue and signals that it's ready for a new task by sending a request. The queue then sends the task as a reply. The server does its work, and sends its results back as a new "I'm ready (oh, and BTW here is the stuff I worked on)" request message.

The queue binds to XREP frontend and backend sockets, and handles requests and replies asynchronously on these using the LRU queue logic. It works with these data structures:

* A pool (a hash map) of all known servers, which identify themselves using unique IDs.
* A list of servers that are ready for work.
* A list of servers that are busy doing work.
* A list of requests sent by clients but not yet successfully processed.

The queue polls all sockets for input and then processes all incoming messages. It queues tasks and distributes them to servers that are alive. Any replies from servers are sent back to their original clients, unless the server is disabled, in which case the reply is dropped.

Idle servers must signal that they are alive with a ready message or a heartbeat, or they will be marked as disabled until they send a message again. This is to detect blocked and disconnected servers (since 0MQ does not report disconnections).

The queue detects a disabled server with a timeout on request processing. If a reply does not come back within (e.g.) 10ms, the queue marks the server as disabled, and retries with the next server.



++++ Server Idle Failure Detection



The server connects its XREQ socket to the queue and uses the LRU approach, i.e. it signals when it's ready for a new task by sending a request, and the queue then sends the task as a reply. It does its work, and sends its results back as a new "I'm ready (oh, and BTW here is the stuff I worked on)" request message. When waiting for work, the server sends a heartbeat message (which is an empty message) to the queue each second. This is why the server uses an XREQ socket instead of a REQ socket (which does not allow multiple requests to be sent before a response arrives).
    +-----------+   +-----------+   +-----------+
    |   Poll    |   |   Poll    |   |   Poll    |
    | Heartbeat |   | Heartbeat |   | Heartbeat |

* If there is just one server in the pool, the we wait with a timeout for the server to reply. If the server does not reply within the timeout, we retry a number of times before abandoning.
* If there are multiple servers in the pool, we try each server in succession, but do not retry the same server twice.
* If a server appears to be really dead (i.e. has not responded for some time), we remove it from the pool.

The server randomly simulates two problems when it receives a task:
1. A crash and restart while processing a request, i.e. close its socket, block for 5 seconds, reopen its socket and restart.
2. A temporary busy wait, i.e. sleep 1 second then continue as normal.

When waiting for work, the server sends a heartbeat message (which is an empty message) to the queue each second. This is why the server uses an XREQ socket instead of a REQ socket (which does not allow multiple requests to be sent before a response arrives).
* Detect a server that dies while idle. We do this with heartbeating: if the idle server does not send a heartbeat within a certain time, we treat it as dead.





++++ Peer-to-Peer Pirate



While many Pirate use cases are *idempotent* (i.e. executing the same request more than once is safe), some are not. Examples of an idempotent Pirate include:

* Stateless task distribution, i.e. a collapsed pipeline where the client is both ventilator and sink, and the servers are stateless workers that compute a reply based purely on the state provided by a request. In such a case it's safe (though inefficient) to execute the same request many times.
* A name service that translates logical addresses into endpoints to bind or connect to. In such a case it's safe to make the same lookup request many times.

And here are examples of a non-idempotent Pirate pattern:

* A logging service. One does not want the same log information recorded more than once.
* Any service that has impact on downstream nodes, e.g. sends on information to other nodes. If that service gets the same request more than once, downstream nodes will get duplicate information.
* Any service that modifies shared data in some non-idempotent way. E.g. a service that debits a bank account is definitely not idempotent.

When our server is not idempotent, we have to think more carefully about when exactly a server might crash. If it dies when it's idle, or while it's processing a request, that's usually fine. We can use database transactions to make sure a debit and a credit are always done together, if at all. If the server dies while sending its reply, that's a problem, because as far as its concerned, it's done its work.

if the network dies just as the reply is making its way back to the client, the same problem arises. The client will think the server died, will resend the request, and the server will do the same work twice. Which is not what we want.

We use the standard solution of detecting and rejecting duplicate requests. This means:

* The client must stamp every request with a unique client identifier and a unique message number.
* The server, before sending back a reply, stores it using the client id + message number as a key.
* The server, when getting a request from a given client, first checks if it has a reply for that client id + message number. If so, it does not process the request but just resends the reply.

The final touch to a robust Pirate pattern is server heartbeating. This means getting the server to say "hello" every so often even when it's not doing any work. The smoothest design is where the client pings the server, which pongs back. We don't need to send heartbeats to a working server, only one that's idle. Knowing when an idle server has died means we don't uselessly send requests to dead servers, which improves response time in those cases.























++++ Reliable Publish-Subscribe (Clone Pattern)

Pubsub is like a radio broadcast, you miss everything before you join, and then how much information you get depends on the quality of your reception. It's so easy to lose messages with this pattern that you might wonder why 0MQ bothers to implement it at all.[[footnote]]If you're German or Norwegian, that is what we call 'humor'. There are many cases where simplicity and speed are more important than pedantic delivery. In fact the radio broadcast covers perhaps the majority of information distribution in the real world. Think of Facebook and Twitter. No, I'm not still joking.[[/footnote]]

However, reliable pubsub is also a useful tool. Let's do as before and define what that 'reliability' means in terms of what can go wrong.

Happens all the time:

* Subscribers join late, so miss messages the server already sent.
* Subscriber connections take a non-zero time, and can lose messages during that time.

Happens exceptionally:

* Subscribers can crash, and restart, and lose whatever data they already received.
* Subscribers can fetch messages too slowly, so queues build up and then overflow.
* Networks can become overloaded and drop data (specifically, for PGM).
* Networks can become too slow, so publisher-side queues overflow.

A lot more can go wrong but these are the typical failures we see in a realistic system. The difficulty in defining 'reliability' now is that we have no idea, at the messaging level, what the application actually does with its data. So we need a generic model that we can implement once, and then use for a wide range of applications.

What we'll design is a simple *shared key-value cache* that stores a set of blobs indexed by unique keys. Don't confuse this with *distributed hash tables*, which solve the wider problem of connecting peers in a distributed network, or with *distributed key-value tables*, which act like non-SQL databases. All we will build is a system that reliably clones some in-memory state from a server to a set of clients. We want to:

* Let a client join the network at any time, and reliably get the current server state.
* Let any client update the key-value cache (inserting new key-value pairs, updating existing ones, or deleting them).
* Reliably propagates changes to all clients, and does this with minimum latency overhead.
* Handle very large numbers of clients, e.g. tens of thousands or more.

The key aspect of the Clone pattern is that clients talk back to servers, which is more than we do in a simple pub-sub dialog. This is why I use the terms 'server' and 'client' instead of 'publisher' and 'subscriber'. We'll use pubsub as part of the Clone pattern but it is more than that.

When a client joins the network, it subscribes a SUB socket, as we'd expect, to the data stream coming from the server (the publisher). This goes across some pub-sub topology (a multicast bus, perhaps, or a tree of forwarder devices, or direct client-to-server connections).

At some undetermined point, it will start getting messages from the server. Note that we can't predict what the client will receive as its first message. If a zmq_connect[3] call takes 10msec, and in that time the server has sent 100 messages, the client might get messages starting from the 100th message.

Let's define a message as a key-value pair. The semantics are simple: if the value is provided, it's an insert or update operation. If there is no value, it's a delete operation. The key provides the subscription filter, so clients can treat the cache as a tree, and select whatever branches of the tree they want to hold.

The client now connects to the server using a different socket (a REQ socket) and asks for a snapshot of the cache. It tells the server two things: which message it received (which means the server has to number messages), and which branch or branches of the cache it wants. To keep things simple we'll assume that any client has exactly one server that it talks to, and gets its cache from. The server *must* be running; we do not try to solve the question of what happens if the server crashes (that's left as an exercise for you to hurt your brain over).

The server builds a snapshot and sends that to the client's REQ socket. This can take some time, especially if the cache is large. The client continues to receive updates from the server on its SUB socket, which it queues but does not process. We'll assume these updates fit into memory. At some point it gets the snapshot on its REQ socket. It then applies the updates to that snapshot, which gives it a working cache.

You'll perhaps see one difficulty here. If the client asks for a snapshot based on message 100, how does the server provide this? After all, it may have sent out lots of updates in the meantime. We solve this by cheating gracefully. The server just sends its current snapshot, but tells the client what its latest message number is. Say that's 200. The client gets the snapshot, and in its queue, it has messages 100 to 300. It throws out 100 to 200, and starts applying 201 to 300 to the snapshot.

Once the client has happily gotten its cache, it disconnects from the server (destroys that REQ socket), which is not used for anything more.

How does Clone handle updates from clients? There are several options but the simplest seems to be that each client acts as a publisher back to the server, which subscribes. In a TCP network this will mean persistent connections between clients and servers. In a PGM network this will mean using a shared multicast bus that clients write to, and the server listens to.

So the client, at startup, opens a PUB socket and part of its initial request to the server includes the address of that socket, so the server can open a SUB socket and connect back to it.

Why don't we allow clients to publish updates directly to other clients? While this would reduce latency, it makes it impossible to sequence messages. Updates *must* pass through the server to make sense to other clients. There's a more subtle second reason. In many applications it's important that updates have a single order, across many clients. Forcing all updates through the server ensures that they have the same order when they finally get to clients.

With unique sequencing, clients can detect the nastier failures - network congestion and queue overflow. If a client discovers that its incoming message stream has a hole, it can take action. It seems sensible that the client contact the server and ask for the missing messages, but in practice that isn't useful. If there are holes, adding more stress to the network will make things worse. All the client can really do is warn its users "Unable to continue", and stop, and not restart until someone has manually checked the cause of the problem.

Clone is complex enough in practice that you don't want to implement it directly in your applications. Instead, it makes a good basis for an application server framework, which talks to applications via the key-value table.

++++ Reliable Pipeline (Harmony Pattern)

0MQ's pipeline pattern (using PUSH and PULL sockets) is reliable to the extent that:

* Workers and collectors don't crash;
* Workers and collectors read their data fast enough to avoid queue overflows.

As with all our reliability patterns, we'll ignore what happens if an upstream node (the ventilator for a pipeline pattern) dies. In practice a ventilator will be the client of another reliability pattern, e.g. Clone.

The Harmony pattern takes pipeline and makes it robust against the only failure we can reasonably handle, namely workers and (less commonly) collectors that crash and lose messages or work.

- assume workers are idempotent
- assume batch size is known in advance (because...)
- assume memory enough to hold full batch
- batch: start (address of collector), tasks, end
- messages numbered 0 upwards inside batch
- assume multiple ventilators for same cluster
- assume collector talks to ventilator, (not same to allow walk-up-and use by ventilators)
- call ventilator the 'client'
- if task missing, resend
- if end of batch missing, resend from last response

++++ Customized Publish-Subscribe

- use identity to route message explicitly to A or B
- not using PUBSUB at all but XREP/????
    - limitations: no multicast, only TCP
    - how to scale with devices...

When a client activates, it chooses a random port that is not in use and creates a SUB socket listening for all traffic on it. The client then sends a message via REQ to the publisher containing the port that it is listening on. The publisher receives this message, acknowledges it, and creates a new pub socket specific to that client. All published events specific to this client go out that socket.

When the client deactivates, it sends a message to the publisher with the port to deactivate and close.

You end up creating a lot more PUB sockets on your server end and doing all of the filtering at the server. This sounds acceptable to you.

I didn't need to do this to avoid network bandwidth bottlenecks; I created this to enforce some security and entitlements.
