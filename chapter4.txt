++ Chapter 4 - Advanced Publish-Subscribe

In Chapter Three we looked at advanced use of 0MQ's request-reply pattern with worked examples. We'll continue this approach in this chapter, as we explore advanced aspects of 0MQ's publish-subscribe pattern.

We'll cover:









++++ Customized Publish-Subscribe

- use identity to route message explicitly to A or B
- not using PUBSUB at all but XREP/????
    - limitations: no multicast, only TCP
    - how to scale with devices...

When a client activates, it chooses a random port that is not in use and creates a SUB socket listening for all traffic on it. The client then sends a message via REQ to the publisher containing the port that it is listening on. The publisher receives this message, acknowledges it, and creates a new pub socket specific to that client. All published events specific to this client go out that socket.

When the client deactivates, it sends a message to the publisher with the port to deactivate and close.

You end up creating a lot more PUB sockets on your server end and doing all of the filtering at the server. This sounds acceptable to you.

I didn't need to do this to avoid network bandwidth bottlenecks; I created this to enforce some security and entitlements.
